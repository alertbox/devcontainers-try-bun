A template repository for trying out [bun, an incredibly faster JS runtime](https://bun.sh), on development containers with [GitHub Codespaces or VS Code - Remote Containers locally](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/#readme).

> If you already have a dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

### What's in it:

- `bun` CLI with runtime
  > [Learn more about bun](https://github.com/apvarun/awesome-bun#videos)
- `git` and `gh` CLI for versioning
- `zsh` integrated terminal for shell scripting
- VS Code extensions for JS/TS and other related work
- `docker` CLI with compose v2

## Using This Template

Using this template repo is easy as [creating a new repo](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/vscode-remote-try-bun/generate) on GitHub.

## Things to Try

Once you have this code opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

With VS Code:
- Open New Terminal
- Type `bun run test-project/http.js`
  > VS Code will prompt to open your favorite browser to show the output.

## Feedback
